echo "46.19.122.85 intra.42.fr" >> /etc/hosts

# Make the intra.42.fr address reroute to 46.19.122.85

# When you add a permanent entry to the local DNS cache on your PC,
# it will always override the information provided by the nameserver.
# If a nameserver gives the wrong address for a domain or
# provides no information at all,
# you can still access the domain if itâ€™s listed in the local Hosts file.
