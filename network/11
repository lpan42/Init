nat-1 (10.60.1.11)

# find the name and IP address of the device that makes the link
# between local network and the outside world

# Network Address Translation (NAT) is the process where a network device,
# usually a firewall, assigns a public address to a computer
# (or group of computers) inside a private network.
# A workstation inside a network makes a request to a computer on the Internet.
# Routers within the network recognize that the request is not for a resource
# inside the network, so they send the request to the firewall.
# The firewall sees the request from the computer with the internal IP.
# It then makes the same request to the Internet using its own public address,
# and returns the response from the Internet resource
# to the computer inside the private network.
